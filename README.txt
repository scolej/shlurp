dead windows accumulating in focus history



technical

pull out modkey which is scattered everywhere

key binds

generalized bindings, mouse / keys, eg: configurable from one place

logging with levels

think about event/command interface

error logger

thing about how to write a log on keypress



and then...
-----------

preserve stacking order while focus cycling

scroll through windows under mouse

minimize

toggle border (might be a must for firefox context menus)

move window colour to conf

ensure adapt to screen resize

double click expand in dir

desktops? configuration registers?

window menu / list and selection.
eg: hold mod4,
get a visual menu with list of windows,
click on them to focus/raise,
right click to minimize

multi-screen snap polish:
shouldn't be able to snap to the outside of other screens bounds

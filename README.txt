TODO
====



must haves
----------

cycle backwards

preserve stack order during switching

sling windows to hot spots with shortcuts
  maximize toggle
  half screen
  vert max
  horz max
  move between screens

close windows

launch progs

keybind for lower to bottom

===> USABLE WM!!



bugs
----

dead windows accumulating in focus history

switching focus with kbd can leave stale state:
clicking in unfocused win does nothing



technical
---------

log as hex

reject configurerequests when drag active

dedupe moves

pull out modkey which is scattered everywhere

key binds

generalized bindings, mouse / keys, eg: configurable from one place

logging with levels

think about event/command interface

error logger

thing about how to write a log on keypress



and then...
-----------

mouse cursor change when hold mod; change based on pos in window

scroll through windows under mouse

minimize

toggle border (might be a must for firefox context menus)

move window colour to conf

ensure adapt to screen resize

double click expand in dir

desktops? configuration registers?

window menu / list and selection.
eg: hold mod4,
get a visual menu with list of windows,
click on them to focus/raise,
right click to minimize

multi-screen snap polish:
shouldn't be able to snap to the outside of other screens bounds

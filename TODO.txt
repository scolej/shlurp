bugs
----

switching focus with kbd can leave stale state:
clicking in unfocused win does nothing
clicks should focus

when i spawn a term, it doesn't get focus.
what about: an action which spawns a new prog which
creates a brief window during which the next mapped window
may take focus. but at all other times newly mapped windows
may not take focus. hmmm. maybe newly mapped windows should
just get focus.

first map leaves windows outside the screen.
maybe there's something wrong with border-width mapping
that gets lost in translation.

remove windows from focus history when they're destroyed

when using lower, and the next mru window is not under the mouse, we'll get
a spurious mouse-enter event which will steal the focus from where it
should go. could probably handle this by not emitting a focus-change event
to the WM until we have received a combo of enter & leave from X; then
discard those triggered by the lower.



technical
---------

todo revise author

generalized bindings, mouse / keys, eg: configurable from one place

logging with levels

think about event/command interface

error logger

think about how to write a log on keypress with state info,
which is currently not trivial

understand the how grabbing raw mod-keys impacts things like sxhkd.
why can't i bind mods and also bind mod-ret from sxhkd?

rethink bindings: BindAction
is there a better way?

rethink the configurerequest-maprequest lifecycle.
some windows (firefox) will send confi



and then...
-----------

preserve stack order during switching

mouse cursor change when hold mod; change based on pos in window

scroll through windows under mouse

minimize

move window colour to conf

ensure adapt to screen resize

double click expand in dir

desktops? configuration registers?

window menu / list and selection.
eg: hold mod4,
get a visual menu with list of windows,
click on them to focus/raise,
right click to minimize

multi-screen snap polish:
shouldn't be able to snap to the outside of other screens bounds

how to resize one-handed?

can i bind mod4 l & r and still use sxhkd for mod4 binds?

confusion. i have an Ev type, which contains pretty much one-to-one
translations of X event types. it currently also has
drag-start/move/finish.

now i want to bind 'super right-click' to 'lower window'. the 'lower
window' idea is both a "command" and an "event"; there's (1) a window has
been lowered and we should update our state to match and (2) i want to
lower a window, make it happen.

how should commands fit in? do we extend the Ev type with key & mouse
events? that way the translation/binding/action can happen inside our
abstraction.

definiteley want to keep "grabbing" outside.
